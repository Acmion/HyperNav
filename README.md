# HyperNav
HyperNav is an advanced and interactive navigation framework that works without JavaScript. 

## Demo
[HyperNav Complete](https://acmion.github.io/HyperNav/testing/complete.html)  
[HyperNav Natural](https://acmion.github.io/HyperNav/testing/natural.html)  
[HyperNav No JavaScript*](https://acmion.github.io/HyperNav/testing/no-js.html)  

*HyperNav does not depend on any JavaScript, but currently switching the theme in the demos is implemented with JS. "HyperNav No JavaScript" has no JS whatsoever, which means that theme switching is not possible. 

## UI & UX Concept Demos

These demos relate to new(at least to the developer) UI and UX concepts regarding navigation menus, which can be created with HyperNav. HyperNav is not
the central piece of these demos, which is why they should primarily be evaluated from an UI and UX perspective.
