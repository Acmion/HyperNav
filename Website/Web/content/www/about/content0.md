# About

HyperNav is a CSS only web navigation menu framework, which came about due to the fact that current CSS frameworks, 
like Bootstrap, do not provide the tools implement a JavaScript-less, infinitely nestable and 
unopinionated navigation menus. Additionally, collapsible and expandable side navigation menus 
with icons have long been a known UI concept, but what about nested collapsible and expandable 
side navigation menus? I first thought about this kind of navigation menu in about 2015, but 
was not able to find nor figure out a UI solution to this problem. Since then I've had this 
in the back of my head, but not actively searching for a solution. In the beginning of 2020 
I began working on HyperNav, during which I revisited the concept of nested collapsible and 
expandable side navigation menus. Finally, I was able to produce a solution that just works 
(not talking about the technical implementation here, but rather the UI and UX experience).
I believe that this navigation menu concept can successfully be used in several projects. See
an example [here](/+/testing/nested-iconified-side-nav-menu-split-buttons.html).
