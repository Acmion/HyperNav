# Basic

The basic HyperNav side navigation menu example. This navigation menu looks
the same on both mobile and desktop devices. In HyperNav the top and side 
navigation menus work with the same markup, with the exception that the
class `.hn-top` has been replaced with `.hn-side`. This example features 
only full expand items.

<div class="example side" data-src="examples/basic.html"></div>
