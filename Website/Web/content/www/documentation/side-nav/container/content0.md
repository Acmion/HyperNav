# Container

You might want to wrap the side navigation menu within an
overlay container. This page shows some ways on how to 
achieve this. All examples on this page have placed the
side menu toggle control within a HyperNav top navigation
menu. Additionally, the class `.hn-no-hover` has been
applied to all expand items, to fix unwanted hover toggles.
However, placing the side menu toggle control within a HyperNav
top navigation menu is not necessary.

## Total Overlay Container

This container overlays all the content of a webpage. Note the class
`.hn-side-container-fixed`.

<div class="example side" data-src="examples/total-overlay.html"></div>

## Top Offsetted Container

This container is offsetted so that it overlays everything except the 
top navigation menu. Note the class `.hn-side-container-top-offset` on 
both `.hn-side-container` and on its associated overlay.

<div class="example side" data-src="examples/top-offsetted-overlay.html"></div>
