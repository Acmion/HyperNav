# Animations

The top navigation menu supports the animations listed on this page.

## Delay

CSS class: `.hn-expand-body-animation-delay`

Usage: Add class to the `.hn-expand-body` element. See [Expand Item](/documentation/general/expand-item/).

Effect: Makes the dropdown menus appear with a slight delay on desktop devices. Thus,
the menus do not dissappear directly, allowing for slight inaccuracies in mouse movement.
