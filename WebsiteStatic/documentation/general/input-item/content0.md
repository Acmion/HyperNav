# Input Item

This page documents the input item in HyperNav. 
These items provide the interactivity that is usually achieved
with JavaScript. Each input item has a separate state element and
the two are connected via an `id`.
The placement of both elements in the DOM is important. The appearance of the input elements 
can easily be changed according to the state by classes provided by HyperNav.
Make note of the usage of `input` and `label` elements.

## Structure

<div class="example only-code" data-src="examples/structure.html"></div>

## Initial State

The initial state of the input item can be manipulated by specifying the `checked` attribute.

<div class="example only-code" data-src="examples/initial-state.html"></div>
